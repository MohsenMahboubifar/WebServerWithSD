# Arduino WebServer with micro SD card

In this project we will try to setup a web server using Arduino Mega2560, Ethernet Shield by using micro SD card to control a LED and we will store html files inside our micro SD card connected to the shield.

# What parts we use for this project :

1. Arduino Mega2560 (and the LED which is embedded on board)
2. Arduino Ethernet Shield
3. USB cable (A male - B male)
4. Network switch
5. micro-SD 16GB (Which can be less even 512MB)
